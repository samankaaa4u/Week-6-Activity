WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW PROJECT AND CONNECT TO THE NEW REPOSITORY IN GITHUB 
1.	git init 
2.	git remote add origin >>Link of the new repository in github<<

Task 4/5: Make two changes to the code and check the files’ statuses. Change some of the files and upload them to GitHub account.
WHEN YOU'RE FILES/PROJECT ARE ALREADY CONNECTED TO GITHUB NEW REPOSITORY AND YOU LIKE TO SEND THE FILES FROM GITHUB NEW REPOSITORY NEED TO TRACK EVERY SINGLE FILES ON GITHUB.
•	git add (space) . 

COMMIT ALL THE FILES IN GITHUB
•	git commit -m "put your commit message in here"

FINALLY SENDING ALL THE FILES FROM GITHUB git push IF ERROR
•	Just copy the message and paste it.

Task 6: Discuss what you have learned from this activity.
I’ve learned that using GitHub is crucial and a must in web development industry. Big tech company such as meta, amazon, x etc. Full stack developer use GitHub to make their work easier and prevent bugs and issues from the website. Developer can document the issues and know what to do next if problems may occur. Also, Developers won’t be easily accidentally buggered it up the website because of the GitHub requirements of each employees role.
